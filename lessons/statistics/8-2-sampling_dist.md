[Think Stats Chapter 8 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2009.html#toc77) (scoring)

**Exercise 1**  In this chapter we used x and median to estimate µ, and found that x yields lower MSE. Also, we used S2 and Sn−12 to estimate σ, and found that S2 is biased and Sn−12 unbiased. Run similar experiments to see if x and median are biased estimates of µ. Also check whether S2 or Sn−12 yields a lower MSE.
