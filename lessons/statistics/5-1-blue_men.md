**Exercise 1**   In the BRFSS (see Section 5.4), the distribution of heights is roughly normal with parameters µ = 178 cm and σ = 7.7 cm for men, and µ = 163 cm and σ = 7.3 cm for women.
In order to join Blue Man Group, you have to be male between 5’10” and 6’1” (see http://bluemancasting.com). What percentage of the U.S. male population is in this range? Hint: use scipy.stats.norm.cdf.
